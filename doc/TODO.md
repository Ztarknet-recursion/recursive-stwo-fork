## Incomplete Implementations

### Lookup sum for public memory
To finish the lookup sum for public memory, need to start with a function that calculates the sum and sum them up, starting with the program, and then the rest.

## FRI Verifier - Degree Bounds

### Check degree bounds
- [ ] Get the degree bounds and check what the degree bounds are
  - This impacts whether we need to implement `FriVerifier` in a way that works with multiple degree bounds
  - Need to understand if different parts of the proof use different degree bounds
  - Determine if a single-degree or multi-degree FRI verifier implementation is required
